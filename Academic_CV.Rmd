# Publications
## Journal Articles

**Mundo, Ariel I.**, Timothy J. Muldoon. "Longitudinal study of metronomic and maximum-tolerated dose strategies reveals different molecular signatures in response to treatment in a primary model of colorectal cancer". ( _In progress, expected date of publication Spring 2022_). In this paper, we use a combination of optics (spectroscopy), molecular biology (qPCR), immunohistochemistry, and semi-parametric statistical models to examine the longitudinal changes caused by different chemotherapeutic dosing strategies, in order to explore the biology of tumor response in a primary model of colorectal cancer.

## Conference Presentations

**Mundo, Ariel I.** "Why we need a better understanding of Statistics to bring reproducibility to biomedical research". Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility, University of Toronto, February 2022. _Accepted_. In this talk I present how biomedical research still struggles with reproducibility, and why I believe we need a "statistical rethinking" on the field in order to have reproducibility as a core component of any future research.
