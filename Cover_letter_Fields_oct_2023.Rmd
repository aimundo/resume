I am writing to express my strong interest in the Grant Writer and Facilitator position at the Fields Institute that was recently advertised. With a background deeply rooted in interdisciplinary research, and extensive training in technical writing during my PhD and postdoctoral experiences, I am confident in my ability to effectively contribute to the Fields Institute in the advertised position.

During my doctoral and postdoctoral training, I have developed valuable expertise in managing and leading interdisciplinary scientific projects encompassing biomedical research, statistics, and public health. My experience has involved not only planning, designing, and conducting research projects but also crafting, editing, and proofreading scientific articles obtained from these research projects. This has equipped me with a keen eye for technical writing, and an ability to quickly adapt to new research environments in order to gain a basic understanding of the topic at hand that I can use to comprehend the ideas and objectives behind each project and adequately craft scientific publications that are compelling and adequate.

In particular, during my postdoctoral position at the University of Montreal under Dr. Bouchra Nasriâ€™s guidance, I significantly contributed in several research projects that demanded comprehensive collaboration and meticulous technical writing. This involved collaborating with members of the lab at different stages (graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, principal investigator), as well as external collaborators help revise, edit, and improve the writing of scientific articles in a wide range of research areas that have included infectious disease modelling, natural disasters, COVID-19, and mpox. 

Additionally, I have experience preparing grant and fellowship submissions for funding bodies in both the United States and Canada. Successful applications in this area in the US include the Fulbright scholarship that I held between 2017-2019, and the Arkansas Biosciences grant that I secured in 2021 toward the end of my PhD, where I was in charge of all the writing process. More recently, I collaborated in the writing, editing, and proofreading of a grant proposal submitted to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) by Dr. Nasri, which was subsequently awarded funding and that scored in the 50% rank within the competition. This experience involved not only extensive writing duties but also continued communication with different collaborators to ensure that the proposal adequately expressed their objectives and aims.

My diverse academic background, which has spanned in the areas of education, basic biomedical research, and public health has sharpened my ability to adapt to various research domains, making me adept at understanding and articulating complex scientific ideas effectively and concisely. Moreover, my academic background has helped me develop my communication skills, both written and verbal, enabling me to engage with multidisciplinary teams and stakeholders efficiently.

As a former MfPH scholar who was funded by the Fields Institute in collaboration with the CRM, working at the Fields Institute would present a unique opportunity to leverage my skills and passion for scientific communication. I am eager to contribute my expertise in grant writing, technical writing, and project management to support the Fields Institute's mission and objectives.

Thank you for time in considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my qualifications and experiences align with the needs of the Grant Writer and Facilitator role.

Sincerely,
