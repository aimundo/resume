I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant training towards my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas. It might seem weird that I am sending this letter to RStudio, as Biomedical Engineering is not a field commonly associated with R. Allow me to provide a little context: All my life, I *hated* Statistics. I suffered enough in College with my Stats classes, and until the first year of my PhD (where I was required to take a Statistics class) I saw Statistics as a necessary evil. All of that changed the day I sat on the computer to try to analyze some data I had been collecting for months (the details of such data are in a paper [**here**](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-25/issue-3/035002/Diffuse-reflectance-spectroscopy-to-monitor-murine-colorectal-tumor-progression-and/10.1117/1.JBO.25.3.035002.full?SSO=1)). 

My desire to learn how to properly analyze this data led me to take a class in R, take advanced Statistics classes and to read multiple Stastics books. The use of `ggplot2` and the `tidyverse` radically changed the way I viewed data analysis and from that moment on, I became an avid R user. My journey with R led to write a paper on statistical methods for biomedical data, where I learned to use `Bookdown`, do some coding in $LaTeX$ and to collaborate using GitHub (the pre-print is available [**here**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.447970v2)).

My main interests are research reproducibility and data visualization. I think I offer a unique set of skills: I have enough experience with R and RStudio to understand how they can be beneficial in a research context (code reproducibility, technical writing, powerful data visualization), but I also understand the mindset of a biomedical researcher and why some may prefer to use Excel and Word for most of their work (oh, and MATLAB). My belief is that there is a need to show the applicability of R in biomedical research and how it can be used as a complete data analysis tool.

I would be delighted to work at RStudio once I finish my PhD, and I believe my skills and my proven track on independent learning make me an ideal candidate for the company. I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.
