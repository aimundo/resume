I have spent the last four years of my PhD trying to better understand the changes caused by colon cancer using a primary murine model. However, it has become clear to me that the way we study any disease (cancer, diabetes, obesity, etc.) in preclinical research is limited by two fundamental reasons: 1) we use animal or cellular models that approximate the behavior of a disease in humans, but that have many inherent limitations, and 2) we usually take "snapshots" of how things change over time. 

The first limitation has repeatedly caused a lack of replicability in the clinical setting from promising results seen in traditional model organisms. Despite this, the scientific community continues to invest heavily in this type of research. The second limitation is even more baffling to me: why are we so accustomed to see things only "before" and "after"? Diseases are progressive! And yet, because we routinely neglect to consider _time_ in our research questions we lack fundamental metabolic and cellular information with enough temporal resolution that enables us to predict not only _how_ things change but also _when_ they change. 

Until we acknowledge the need for longitudinal information in all areas of science, we are condemned to see not only a lack of replicability in results, but a growing disorganized array of information that will not help us to give definite answers to many biological problems (e.g., the Warburg effect in cancer).

My next career choice is not solely focused on discoveries that help tackle the limitations mentioned above for a specific disease, but also in laying the theoretical and practical foundations on _how_ to address these questions systematically for any biological process in an interdisciplinary manner where novel approaches across Statistics, Biology and Bioinformatics can be leveraged in order to help change what we consider "paradigms" in the scientific community. 

I believe my unique scientific superpower is perseverance, and I think it would be best suited by
